```

## Available Templates

1. **React**: Basic React template with MUD integration
2. **React ECS**: Entity Component System based React template
3. **Phaser**: 2D game development with Phaser.js
4. **ThreeJS**: 3D game development with Three.js
5. **Vanilla**: Basic JavaScript template without framework

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

pnpm test
```

## Smart Contract Integration

The project includes a built-in Adventure Layer System with the following core functions:

- `adventureHeatbeat()`: Manages game state updates
- `adventureAccountLogin()`: Handles player authentication
- `adventureStartGame()`: Initializes game sessions
- `adventureEndGame()`: Manages game completion
